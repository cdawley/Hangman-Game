#CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

#### __Hangman-style "word guess" game themed on _CAPITAL PUNISHMENT_ (with with capital letters for some kind of triple pun)__.

Most of the game itself is an object titled "game" in the __game.js__ file. This file is linked in the HTML (game site created using Bootstrap). JavaScript related to key entry is within <script> tags in the page itself.

The game is played in rounds. A round is over when a player correctly guesses the word or runs out of chances. Players receive 6 chances per round (thats two legs, two arms, a head, and a final chance for the head when the counter is at zero). If the round is lost, the word is returned to the array from which words are drawn each round. When all words have been guessed, the player is notified to as such, and instructed to refresh the the page to play again.

It wasn't my intention to make a joke out of __the death penalty__. I think that death sentences; state-sanctioned killing of a person as punishment for killing another person in an attempt to teach other humans that killing is wrong, is as ridiculous as it sounds in _this_ __sentence__. That there is any humor here is more about my seeing an opportunity for a pun when instructed to create a 'hangman' game. Although these words are meant more as a statement of my belief and opinion than a disclaimer,  I'd like it to be known that I do not support capital punishment, and in reality murder of any sort is no laughing matter.
